### Requirements
1. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) installed at default install location.

2. A scene in OBS Studio named "Zoom Meet" with recording set to Zoom Meeting screen with audio source and mic(If required). It is only required only for initial run not regularly. Just User don't have to interfere in "Zoom Meet" Profile afterwards
   
3. [Python v3](https://www.python.org/)

4. Python libraries : datetime, os, errno, sys, tkinter, PIL, time, sqlite3, subprocess, math, platform, webbrowser
  
   (All libraries except PIL,ttkthemes are installed by default in Python)
  
   PIL can be installed by using given commands in Terminal/CMD.
   ```markdown
   pip install pillow
   OR
   pip3 install pillow
   
   AND
   
   pip install ttkthemes
   OR
   pip3 install ttkthemes
   ```
  
5. [Zoom Meeting](https://zoom.us/) App Installed with disabled setting for camera on at autojoin and enabled for computer audio on autojoin.

### Notes
- Recording is supported right now only in Linux and Windows
- App hasn't been run on windows PC. So possible error may exists.
- It might be possible that bashCommand in LoadService.launchRecordingbyOBS may give error in terminal. User may need to manually modify it.
- Since recording through Linux is through Software Encoding, users may notice high CPU usage of OBS Studio. To fix it user may follow steps given in comments of main.py file.

### Build an executable
You can build your own executable by using pyinstaller, nuitka or any other [compiler](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyoxidizer_comparisons.html) that you like
- UNIX based Systems(Linux,MacOS etc)
```markdown
pyinstaller --noconsole --windowed --add-data "data:data" -i"data/icon.ico" --collect-submodules PIL main.py
```
- Windows
```markdown
pyinstaller --noconsole --windowed --add-data "data;data" -i"data/icon.ico" --collect-submodules PIL main.py
```
- Any OS(es) [Not Recommended to Novice Users] 
{Unstable;Contains Bug}
```markdown
python3 -m nuitka --standalone --nofollow-imports --remove-output --no-pyi-file --include-package=PIL --include-module=ttkthemes --output-dir=app_build --enable-plugin=tk-inter --onefile --include-data-dir=data=data --windows-icon-from-ico=data/icon.ico main.py
```

### Workaround for Nuitka Build
After building the binary, copy 'ttkthemes' folder from site-packages folder(in lib directory) from your standard python installation location, to remove importing issue.
- To run the binary, open terminal in <Project-location>/app_build/main.dist directory then type and run main.exe or ./main depending on your OS.

- Running may give a error after the app window is closed.(Any Suggestion/Workaround on this are welcome)
     ```
     ............/zoomRecorder/build3/main.dist/tkinter/__init__.py", line 4025, in __del__
     TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed
     )
     ```
- Novice Users are warned against using Nuitka build due to its comparatively more complex installation than pyinstaller and increased build size and present bugs in compiling the script on it.(Nuitka builds are performance-wise faster btw)

### âš  Warning
- Since it is in early development phase it might be possible that app may not work at all. Feel free to report any bugs if it exists.
- I admit that UI for loading Service screen is a bit unresponsive on starting service which may be resolved in later updates.

### Roadmap
1. Check if rejoin feature works
2. Debug the app
3. Make app feel more responsive

### Alternatives
- Warning - User discretion required! I don't any responsibility for any issues faced while using these alternatives.
  They are just for inormative purpose only. I personally haven't tested either of these except [AutoRecorder](https://github.com/SMazeikis/AutoRecorder).
- It is worth mentioning that some of these alternative work without using any 3rd party recording software, which is a really great feature to look on!
- Well Documented
